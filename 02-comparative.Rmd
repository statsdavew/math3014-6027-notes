# Completely randomised designs {#crd}

The simplest form of experiment we will consider compares $t$ different **unstructured** treatments. By unstructured, we mean the treatments form a discrete collection, not related through the settings of other experimental features (compare with factorial experiments in Chapter \@ref(factorial)). We also make the assumption that there are no restrictions in the randomisation of treatments to experimental units (compare with Chapter \@ref(blocking) on blocking). A designs for such an experiment is therefore called a **completely randomised design** (CRD).

Pulp experiment [@WH2009, ch. 2]

In a paper pulping mill, an experiment was run to examine differences between the reflectance (brightness; ratio of amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking the target) of sheets of pulp made by $t=4$ operators. The data are given in Table \@ref(tab:pulp-expt-data) below.

```{r pulp-expt-data, warning = F}
pulp <- data.frame(operator = rep(factor(1:4), 5),
                   repetition = rep(1:5, rep(4, 5)), 
                   reflectance = c(59.8, 59.8, 60.7, 61.0, 60.0, 60.2, 60.7, 60.8, 
                                    60.8, 60.4, 60.5, 60.6, 60.8, 59.9, 60.9, 60.5, 59.8, 60.0, 60.3, 60.5)
                     )
knitr::kable(
 tidyr::pivot_wider(pulp, names_from = operator, values_from = reflectance)[, -1],
 col.names = paste("Operator", 1:4),
 caption = "Pulp experiment: reflectance values (unitless) from four different operators."
)
```

The experiment has one factor (operator) with four levels (sometimes called a one-way layout). The CRD employed has equal replication of each treatment (operator).

We can informally compare the responses from these four treatments graphically.

```{r pulp-boxplot, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Pulp experiments: distributions of reflectance from the four operators.'}
boxplot(reflectance ~ operator, data = pulp)
```
Figure \@ref(fig:pulp-boxplot) shows that, relative to the variation, there may be a difference in the mean response between treatments 1 and 2, and 3 and 4. In this chapter, we will see how to make this comparison formally using linear models, and to assess how the choice of design impacts our results.
:::

Throughout this chapter we will assume the $i$th treatment is applied to $n_i$ experimental unit, with total number of runs $n = \sum_{i=1}^t n_i$ in the experiment.

## A unit-treatment linear model

An appropriate, and common, model to describe data from such experiments when the response is continuous is given by

\begin{equation}
y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}\,, \quad i = 1, \ldots, t; j = 1, \ldots, n_i\,, 
(\#eq:utm)
\end{equation}

where $y_{ij}$ is the response from the $j$th application of treatment $i$, $\mu$ is a constant parameter, $\tau_i$ is the effect of the $i$th treatment, and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the random individual effect from each experimental unit with $E(\varepsilon_{ij})$ and $\mathrm{Var}(\varepsilon_{ij}) = \sigma^2$. All random errors are assumed independent and here we also assume $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.

Model \@ref(eq:utm) assumes that each treatment can be randomly allocated to one of the $n$ experimental units, and that this allocation is independent of the allocation of all the other treatments.

Why is this model appropriate and commonly used? The expected response from the application of the $i$th treatment is

$$
E(y_{ij}) = \mu + \tau_i\,.
$$
The parameter $\mu$ can be thought of as representing the impact of many different features particular to **this** experiment, and $\tau_i$ is the deviation due to applying treatment $i$. From the applicable of two different hypothetical experiments, A and B, the expected response from treatment $i$ may be different due to a different overall mean. From experiment A:

$$
E(y_{ij}) = \mu_{\mathrm{A}} + \tau_i\,.
$$
From experiment B:
$$
E(y_{ij}) = \mu_{\mathrm{B}} + \tau_i\,.
$$
But the **difference** between treatments $k$ and $l$ ($k, l = 1,\ldots, t$)

\begin{align*}
E(y_{kj}) - E(y_{lj}) & = \mu_A + \tau_k - \mu_A - \tau_l \\
& = \tau_k - \tau_l\,,
\end{align*}

is constant across different experiments. This concept of **comparison** underpins most design of experiments, and will be applied throughout this module.

## The partitioned linear model

In matrix form, we can write model \@ref(eq:utm) as

$$
\by = X_1\mu + X_2\btau + \bvarepsilon\,,
$$
where $X_1 = \boldsymbol{1}_n$, the $n$-vector with every entry equal to one, 

$$
X_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\boldsymbol{1}_{n_1} & \boldsymbol{0}_{n_1} & \cdots &  \boldsymbol{0}_{n_1} \\
\boldsymbol{0}_{n_2} & \boldsymbol{1}_{n_2} & \cdots &  \boldsymbol{0}_{n_2} \\
\vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \\
\boldsymbol{0}_{n_t} & \boldsymbol{0}_{n_t} & \cdots &  \boldsymbol{1}_{n_t} \\
\end{bmatrix}\,,
$$
with $\boldsymbol{0}_{n_i}$ is the $n_i$-vector with every entry equal to zero, $\btau = [\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_t]^{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\bvarepsilon = [\varepsilon_{11}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{tn_t}]^{\mathrm{T}}$.

Why are we partitioning the model? Going back to our discussion of the role of $\mu$ and $\tau_i$, it is clear that we not interested in estimating $\mu$, which represents an experiment-specific contribution to the expected mean. Our only interest is in estimating the (differences between the) $\tau_i$. Hence, we can treat $\mu$ as a nuisance parameter.

If we define $X = [X_1\, \vert\, X_2]$ and $\bbeta^{\mathrm{T}} = [\mu \vert \btau^{\mathrm{T}}]$, we can write the usual least squares equations

\begin{equation}
X^{\mathrm{T}}X\hat{\bbeta} = X^{\mathrm{T}}\by
(\#eq:crd-ls)
\end{equation}
as a system of two matrix equations

\begin{align*}
X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1\hat{\mu} + X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_2\hat{\btau} & = X_1^{\mathrm{T}}\by \\
X_2^{\mathrm{T}}X_1\hat{\mu} + X_2^{\mathrm{T}}X_2\hat{\btau} & = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}\by\,. \\
\end{align*}

Assuming $(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}$ exists, which it does in this case, we can pre-multiply the first of these equations by $X_2^{\mathrm{T}}X_1(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}$ and subtract it from the second equation to obtain

\begin{align*}
X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - X_1(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}X_1^{\mathrm{T}}]X_1\hat{\mu} 
& + X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - X_1(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}X_1^{\mathrm{T}}]X_2\hat{\btau} \\
& = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - X_1(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}X_1^{\mathrm{T}}]\by\,.
\end{align*}

Writing $H_1 = X_1(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1}X_1^{\mathrm{T}}$, we obtain

\begin{equation}
X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - H_1]X_1\hat{\mu} + X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - H_1]X_2\hat{\btau} = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - H_1]\by\,.
(\#eq:almost-reduced)
\end{equation}
The matrix $H_1$ is a "hat" matrix for a linear model containing only the term $\mu$, and hence $H_1X_1 = X_1$ (see MATH2010). Hence the first term in \@ref(eq:almost-reduced) is zero, and we obtain the **reduced normal equations** for $\btau$:

\begin{equation}
X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - H_1]X_2\hat{\btau} = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}[I_n - H_1]\by\,.
(\#eq:crd-red-normal)
\end{equation}

Note that the solutions from \@ref(eq:crd-red-normal) are not different from the solution to $\hat{\btau}$ that would be obtained from solving \@ref(eq:crd-ls); equation \@ref(eq:crd-red-normal) is simply a re-expression, where we have eliminated the nuisance parameter $\mu$. This fact means that we rarely need to solve \@ref(eq:crd-red-normal) explicitly.

Recalling that for a hat matrix, $I_n - H_1$ is idempotent and symmetric (see MATH2010), if we define 

$$
X_{2|1} = (I_n - H_1)X_2\,,
$$
then we can rewrite equation \@ref(eq:crd-red-normal) as

\begin{equation}
X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}X_{2|1}\hat{\btau} = X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}\by\,, 
(\#eq:rne)
\end{equation}

which are the normal equations for a linear model with expectation $E(\by) = X_{2|1}\btau$.

## Reduced normal equations for the CRD

For the CRD discussed in this chapter, $X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1 = n$, the total number of runs in the experiment^[In later chapters we will see examples where $X_1$ has $>1$ columns, and hence $X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1$ is a matrix.]. Hence $(X_1^{\mathrm{T}}X_1)^{-1} = 1/n$ and $H_1 = \frac{1}{n}J_n$, with $J_n$ the $n\times n$ matrix with all entries equal to 1. 

The adjusted model matrix then has the form

\begin{align*}
X_{2|1} & = (I_n - H_1)X_2 \\
& = X_2 - \frac{1}{n}J_nX_2 \\
& = X_2 - \frac{1}{n}[n_1\boldsymbol{1}_n \vert \cdots \vert n_t\boldsymbol{1}_n]\,. 
\end{align*}

That is, every column of $X_2$ has been adjusted by the subtraction of the column mean from each entry^[Often called "column centred"]. Also notice that each row of $X_{2|1}$ has a row-sum equal to zero ($= 1 - \sum_{i=1}^tn_t/n$). Hence, $X_{2|1}$ is not of full column rank, and so the reduced normal equations do not have a unique solution.
<!--
^[If we recalled the material on "dummy" variables from MATH2010 chapter 5, we would already have realised this.].
-->

In MATH2010 we fitted models with categorical variables by defining a set of dummy variables and estimating a reduced model. Here, we will take a slightly different approach and study which combinations of parameters from \@ref(eq:utm) are estimable, and in particular which linear combinations of the treatment parameters $\tau_i$ we can estimate. 

Let's study equation \@ref(eq:rne) in more detail. We have

\begin{align*}
X^{\mathrm{T}}_{2|1}X_{2|1} & = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}(I_n - H_1)X_2 \\
 & = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}X_2 - X_2^{\mathrm{T}}H_1X_2 \\
 & = \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{n}) - \frac{1}{n}X_2^{\mathrm{T}}J_nX_2 \\
 & = \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{n}) - \frac{1}{n}\boldsymbol{n}\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{T}}\,,
\end{align*}

where $\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{T}} = (n_1, \ldots, n_t)$. Hence, the reduced normal equations become

\begin{align}
\left[\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{n}) - \frac{1}{n}\boldsymbol{n}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{n}\right]\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}} & = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}\by - \frac{1}{n}X_2^{\mathrm{T}}J_n\by \\
& = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}\by - \boldsymbol{n}\bar{y}_{..}\,,
(\#eq:crd-rne)
\end{align}

where $\bar{y}_{..} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^t\sum_{j = 1}^{n_i} y_{ij}$, i.e. the overall average of the observations from the experiment.

From \@ref(eq:crd-rne) we obtain a system of $t$ equations, each having the form

$$
n_i\hat{\tau}_i - n_i\hat{\tau}_w = n_i\bar{y}_{i.} - n_i\bar{y}_{..}\,,
$$
where $\hat{\tau}_w = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^tn_i\hat{\tau}_i$ and $\bar{y}_{i.} = \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j = 1}^{n_i}y_{ij}$ $(i = 1, \ldots, t)$.

These $t$ equations are not independent; they sum to zero due to the linear dependency between the columns of $X_{2|1}$. Hence, there is no unique solution to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$ from equation \@ref(crd-rne). However, we can estimate certain linear combinations of the $\tau_i$, called *contrasts*.

## Contrasts

::: {.definition #contrast}
A treatment **contrast** is a linear combination $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{\tau}$ with coefficient vector $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (c_1,\ldots, c_t)$ such that $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{1} = 0$; that is, $\sum_{i = 1}^t c_i = 0$.
:::

For example, assume we have $t = 3$ treatments, then the following vectors $\boldsymbol{c}$ all define contrasts:

1. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (1, -1, 0)$,
2. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (1, 0, -1)$,
3. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (0, 1, -1)$.

In fact, they define all ${3\choose 2} = 3$ pairwise comparisons between treatments. The following are also contrasts:

4. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (2, -1, -1)$,
5. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (0.5, -1, 0.5)$,

each comparing the sum, or average, of expected responses from two treatments to the expected response from the remaining treatment.

The following are not contrasts, as $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{1} \ne 0$:

6. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (2, -1, 0)$,
7. $\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}} = (1, 0, 0)$,

with the final example once again demonstrating that we cannot estimate the individual $\tau_i$.

## Contrast estimators in the CRD


<!--
We start with a short digression to discuss the concept of a generalised inverse.

## Generalised inverses

A generalised inverse of a square, symmetric matrix $A$ is any matrix $A^{-}$ that satisfies

$$
AA^{-}A = A\,.
$$

If matrix $A$ is of full column rank, then there is a single generalised inverse $A^{-} = A^{-1}$, the usual inverse matrix. In other cases, there may be infinitely many choices for $A^{-}$.

## Solutions to the reduced normal equations

We can use a generalised inverse to generate solutions to \@ref(eq:rne) of the form:

$$
\hat{\btau} = (X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}X_{2|1})^{-}X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}\by\,.
$$
Substituting this expression into \@ref(eq:rne), we obtain

\begin{align*}
X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}X_{2|1}(X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}X_{2|1})^{-}X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}\by & = X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}H_{2|1}\by \\ 
& = X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}\by\,,
\end{align*}

where $H_{2|1} = X_{2|1}(X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}X_{2|1})^{-}X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}$ and $X_{2|1}^{\mathrm{T}}H_{2|1} = X^{\mathrm{T}}_{21}$^[This equality follows from $H$ being the projection matrix for the column space of $X$.].

The reduced normal equations therefore take the form  

$$
X_2^{\mathrm{T}}\left[I_n - \frac{1}{n}J_n\right]X_2\hat{\btau} = X_2^{\mathrm{T}}\left[I_n - \frac{1}{n}J_n\right]\by\,.
$$
